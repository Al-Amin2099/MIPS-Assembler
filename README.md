# MIPS-Assembler
This program reads instructions in the MIPS assembly language and translating them into the appropriate machine code. A user will be able to use the UI to enter either an instruction or the machine code of the instruction that they want to translate, and the output will be the appropriate translation.

- Lexical Analysis: Breaking down the input program into meaningful tokens.
- Syntax Parsing: Ensuring correct formatting and sequencing of assembly instructions.
- Symbol Table Management: Resolving memory addresses for variables and jump labels.
- Machine Code Generation: Converting instructions into the appropriate binary opcodes and data formats.
